        <h2>How It All Began</h2>
        <p>We started as a small YouTube channel with an idea to make easy crafts and DIY for kids with an enthusiastic group. To further develop and reach out more audience, here we created a website. We would like to post DIYs, Special makings, Home Decors, Wall Hangings, Gift cards, Greeting cards, Special festivals in a simple and innovative way. We will show our continuous efforts to amaze you with our creative crafts.</p>
        <p>We achieved a major milestone of 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch hours in less span of time. And continue to raise with over 6300+ subscribers and 6.1+ million channel impressions as on 13 july,2021. We made more than 180 videos and got very good support.</p>

        <h2>Journey</h2>
        <p>Our team has a talented and creative craft maker, she was working as a school teacher. Due to pandemic, she stopped working, but interest in educating kids didn’t stopped in her. Then with her nephews got an idea to start YouTube channel to connect with people. </p>
        <p>Early days were really tougher for any YouTube without any background, the same happened with us. But with all new people support and encouragement, we started working hard learnt new things.</p>
        <p>First Video got good response and we continuously started uploading two videos per week. Live videos also make us stronger. We’ve conducted live quiz contest on YouTube, Top three contestants got some good prizes from our side on Amazon. </p>
        <p>Short videos enhanced us. When the time with low views and impressions, YouTube introduced short videos called YouTube Shorts. It’s a good kick for us to grow more we started to do more short videos and they became viral. On Independence Day, festivals like Sankranti boosted our short videos.</p>
        <p>Our Crafts are mainly made with easily available apparatus like paper, scissor, glue and colour pens. This will increase creativity in kids mind and relaxation with a joy.</p>
